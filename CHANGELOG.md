Removed default features for `chrono` in order to eliminate subdependency on `time@0.1.45`. Removing this subdependency is required by an advisory [here (CVE-2020-26235)](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/602).

Tiny optimization for reading `Guid`.

## [0.2.1] - 2019-06-01

Some documentation refreshment.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-05-30

A lot of internal refactoring has been done, the library is now ready for experimentation.

## [0.1.1] - 2019-05-23

Still a work in progress - `winstructs is still considered in beta.`

## [0.1.0] 

The library was originally forked from https://github.com/forensicmatt/r-winstructs,
but most implementations were heavily modified, so none of the old API will probably work. 

### Changed
- Reimplemented most of the structs from `r-winstructs`
